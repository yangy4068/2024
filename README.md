Integrated intensity maps of molecular lines. The pentagram symbol denotes the position of identified infall source. The green, yellow, and orange points denote the Class I, Flat-spectrum, Class II YSOs \citep{Kuhn+etal+2021}, respectively. The blue, magenta, orange, and red crosses denote the 95 GHz methanol masers \citep{Yang+etal+2017}, 6.7 GHz methanol masers \citep{Yang+etal+2019}, H$_2$O masers \citep{Anglada+etal+1996,Valdettaro+etal+2001}, and OH masers \citep{Qiao+etal+2016,Qiao+etal+2018,Qiao+etal+2020}. For soueces that have more than one clump within the observed areas, we have labeled these clumps as A, B and C, etc. The black circles on the lower left indicate the beam sizes of the IRAM 30 m telescope.
